## Project Description

### Part 1: Obtaining Data 
In this section, we obtained various datasets for our five cities (Chicago, New York, LA, Pheonix, and Houston) from the [U.S. Census Database](INSERT LINE!!!). (Note: also sourced below). We used various criteria and table codes to pull the tables within the four metrics. After codes were found, the data was  cleaned, and organized into new CSV files. 

### Part 2: Major City Analysis 
After datasets were loaded and previewed, analysis was performed.

## Results & Analysis 


### Challenges 
Some challenges we faced during this were the amount of data we could pull online and the content available. We were not able to find any actual data for Amazon Prime, which was the lowest-rated streaming service, so we had to use Netflix, which came in second lowest. We also wished to analyze HBO more, but there was little free data available to us. This is why we selected Netflix since we were able to find a CSV file of a section of data from the company. 

We also assumed that Netflix would be the top ranking in all categories, and we originally proposed this in our outline. However, that was not the case, and HBO Max took the number one spot. We were also planning on looking at yearly data, more specifically during COVID years. Again, there was little to no 'free' available data for us to use. This ended up restricting us when analyzing, so we shifted to looking at demographics more.

## Conclusion
Overall, whether we want to acknowledge it or not, streaming platforms are the future, and they will only continue to grow as technology prospers. This can be a good and bad thing in this day and age as the rapid rate of technology evolution changes what the average human knows. The downside to all of this is that as the demand increases, so does the cost of the service and the availability of titles on each different streaming platform. As seen earlier, not every platform has the same titles, which pushes for the need to enroll in several different streaming services. Lastly, it's not always that more content equals a higher rating, and that can be seen with Amazon. Netflix's issue, however, is most likely due to the crackdown on password sharing and constantly increased costs over time. A deeper analysis of a stock portfolio and quarterly profit will need to be evaluated.
